      summary: P2P Card Credit
      description: |
        This endpoint allows a merchant to perform a peer-to-peer (P2P) card credit transaction, transferring funds directly to a recipient's card number or a stored receiver token. The request must include either `receiver_card_number` or `receiver_rectoken`, along with transaction details such as `order_id`, `order_desc`, and `amount`.

        To secure this request, the merchant must generate a signature using their Credit private key specifically for `p2pcredit` operations.

        - Capture Pre-Purchase
      summary: Capture Pre-Authorized Payment
      description: |
        This endpoint allows a merchant to capture a previously pre-authorized amount on a card. The capture operation is the second stage in a two-stage payment scheme, where the initial amount was held during a pre-authorization request (`preauth = Y`). This capture can be a full or partial capture of the amount.

        > 📘 Note
        > This operation applies only to card payments. If capture is not completed, only a reversal of the full held amount is available.
